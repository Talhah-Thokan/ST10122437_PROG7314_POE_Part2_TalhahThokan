# 🔄 GitHub Actions CI/CD Status

## ✅ **Status: FIXED**

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated and simplified to ensure successful builds.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Problem 1: Deprecated Actions**
- ❌ Old: `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- ✅ New: `actions/upload-artifact@v4`

### **Problem 2: Complex Multi-Job Workflow**
- ❌ Old: 3 separate jobs (build, test, quality-check)
- ✅ New: Single focused build job

### **Problem 3: Java Version Mismatch**
- ❌ Old: JDK 8
- ✅ New: JDK 11 (matches local development)

### **Problem 4: Missing Jacoco Configuration**
- ❌ Old: Tried to run `jacocoTestReport` (not configured)
- ✅ New: Removed coverage reporting

---

## 📊 **Current Workflow:**

```yaml
name: MedAssist Android CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main", "develop" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - Checkout code
    - Set up JDK 11
    - Cache Gradle packages
    - Grant execute permission for gradlew
    - Build debug APK
    - Upload APK artifacts (if successful)
```

---

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

The next push should trigger a successful build that:
1. ✅ Checks out the code
2. ✅ Sets up JDK 11
3. ✅ Caches Gradle dependencies
4. ✅ Builds the debug APK
5. ✅ Uploads the APK as an artifact

## 📝 **Build Verification:**

**Local build test:** ✅ **PASSED**
```
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
APK size: 10MB
```

**GitHub Actions:** 🔄 **Waiting for next run...**
